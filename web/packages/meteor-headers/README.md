# headers

Access HTTP headers on both server and client (+ clientIP funcs).

For a working demo, see [headers.meteor.com](http://headers.meteor.com/).

For Meteor < 0.6.5, you need to use meteor-headers 0.0.7.

Since 0.0.18, headers are sent down with the initial page access
and are available immediately, except when appcache is used.
So, please still use the `headers.ready()` callback.  Additionally,
`proxyCount` is deprecated,
please use set the `HTTP_FORWARDED_COUNT` environment variable instead.

## Two different types of Headers

When working with Meteor, it's important to understand that there are
two different kinds of headers we might be interested in.

* **Initial connection headers** -- these are the headers sent to the
initial page access.  They are contain a lot of things NOT present
in XHR/DDP socket calls.  See the difference at [headers.meteor.com](http://headers.meteor.com/).

* **DDP headers** -- these are the headers sent on the DDP request,
available inside publish and method functions, and accessible directly
via `this.connection.httpHeaders` since Meteor 0.7.1.  `methodHeaders`
is still available for now, but might be removed in the future.

See more below.

## On the Client

Use `headers.get()` to access HTTP headers sent by the client.
`headers.get(key)` will retrieve a specific header, e.g.
headers.get('host'), whereas headers.get() will return an object
with all headers.

Note that all header field names are *lowercase*.  e.g. 
`headers.get('accept-language')`, `headers.get('x-forwarded-for')`,
etc (like with ExpressJS [req.get](http://expressjs.com/api.html#req.get)).

Headers are available as soon as the package is loaded, i.e. before any
of your app code is run, provided appcache is not used.  To be safe,
run any code that relies on `headers.get` like this:

```js
headers.ready(function() {
	console.log(headers.get());
});
```

It's confusing, but `headers.ready()` called without any arguments
is a reactive `ready()` function which could be used in all the usual
places (e.g. with iron-router's waitOn).  `headers.get()` is reactive
too.  You can use this for example with iron-router to ensure that
the headers are available before the first route is executed (no
longer required since 0.0.13):

```js
  Router.map(function() {
    this.route('/', {
      template: 'hello',
      loadingTemplate: 'loading',
      waitOn: headers,
      action: function() {
        // Will only be happen once.  Without the waitOn, you'll see it happens
        // twice, once before headers are ready, and once after they've arrived.
        console.log(headers.get());
      }
    })
  });
```

For more info see the relevant sections in the iron-router docs.

See the notes below on how we retrieve the headers, why it's necessary
to do it this way, and also the note about `getClientIP()`.

The following headers are NOT sent back to the client:

* **cookie** - dangerous, can be used to bypass httpOnly.  access via JS.
* **authorization** - uneeded, potentially dangerous
* **user-agent** - uneeded, access via `navigator.userAgent`

## On the Server

As above, but you need to pass `this` as the first argument.  e.g.
`headers.get(this)` or `headers.get(this, 'host')`, and likewise,
`headers.ready(this)`.  For callbacks / anonymous functions, use
`var self=this;` and call `headers.get(self)` from within the func.

Available in Meteor methods and publish functions.  There is no way
to do this for Collection allow/denies unfortunately (but since that
relies on a userId, you could use your own logic to set the latest
headers per userId)`

Note, `headers.get()` will always provide the headers for the
INITIAL CONNECTION and not the headers for the current connection
of the open socket, which is used for publish/methods.  Use
`headers.methodGet(this)` to get those headers.

## getClientIP() -- freebie

Since a common use for getting the headers to is to check the client's IP
address (especially when using a proxy / loadbalancer), I threw in the most
common pattern for this.

Usage: `headers.getClientIP()`

Note, this requires you to set the HTTP_FORWARDED_COUNT environment
variable (same as Meteor) with the number of known proxies (that you
trust) behind the connection.

Explanation: each proxy in the chain appends to the X-Forwarded-For header, such that if you know the number of proxies, you can work out the initial IP address that the first proxy
in the chain specified as the end user's IP address. Thus, even if the end-user sends a request with his own X-Forwarded-For header, you can ignore these fake IPs. In the case where the user's ISP has a transparent proxy, you'll get that proxy's IP... but that remains the only IP that you know for sure is real.  See [issue #2](https://github.com/gadicohen/meteor-headers/issues/2)

### methodClientIP() -- server only

Usage: `var ip = headers.methodClientIP(this);` (inside a Meteor method)

IP address of client connected to the socket over which the Method is running.
The same as `this.connection.clientAddress` in Meteor 0.7.1+.

## How and why this all works

Intro: headers **have to** come from the server.  Headers are NOT available
from the browser via Javascript.  There's a trick to make an XHR request in the
browser to get the headers, but note, this does NOT INCLUDE ALL HEADERS (see
which headers at [headers.meteor.com](http://headers.meteor.com/)).
Unfortunately the ONLY reliable method, to get all headers with their correct
values, that the client sends to the server, is via the server.

1. On the initial request, all headers are returned on the initial page
load and loaded on the client (injected into the HEAD, before even
loading meteor-headers client side code).  The headers are also returned
with a unique token generated for each request.

2. When client code is loaded, we use a meteor method to send the above
token back to the server, where we can reassociate the headers from the
original request to the current socket.  This allows for headers.get()
(as opposed to headers.methodGet) to return the correct data, which is
kept in the connection session (maintained by livedata).

When appcache is used, we don't get the original HTML page with the headers
on it, so we just make a script call to an additional internal script to get
them.
